# golang-modules

ðŸ‘‹ Hello

This repository is a compilation of basic Go modules. <br/>

If Go is set-up on a local machine use `go mod init` command along with name of the module or path to the module. <br/>
Once MOD file is created use the command `go run .` to run the main.go file.

Notes on Golang:

- Go is grouped into packages, and packages are grouped into modules.
- Modules specify dependency to run the code which includes the Go version and other modules used in the code.
- Golang compiler always looks for main function.
- Errors are handled by Go standard library `errors` package.
